# AquaFizzer

AquaFizzer is a project, created in the economics and law lessons on the Rhabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium St. Ottilien (Germany). The idea behind the project was to develop a business idea. In a team of five we then developed aquafizzer. An aquafizzer is a bottle that has a built-in fizzing mechanism.

## Website
This website was created 2 days before delivery, because I got bored on Sunday. It's a simple (mostly) responsive website. The design is inspired by [My-Gainplan](my-gainplan.com).
